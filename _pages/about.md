I am a junior student at the University of Pennsylvania completing my B.A. in `Computer Science` and `Computational Biology`, also pursuing my Accelerated MSE in `Robotics`.

As a Premed-turned CS student, technology and life science research are my greatest passions. Previously I served as an undergraduate researcher at the [Yang Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/yanglab/) `@Penn Cancer Biology`, where I studied the protein chaperone systems that protects against neurodegeneration. I also served as an undergraduate researcher at the [Korb Lab](https://www.korblab.com/) `@Penn Epigenetics Institute`, where I contributed to the lab's most recent preprint on [Histone variant H2BE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39553997/) as a co-author.

Currently, I am the founding Software Engineering Intern at [Grove AI](https://grovetrials.com/), where I contributed to and spearheaded multiple projects across the company's tech stack, ranging from building a . Im Summer 2025, I will be working at NVIDIA's Santa Clara office as a Software Infrastructure Intern on the Autonomous Vehicles team.

Check out my latest personal work: [Fusion](https://stevensusas.github.io/projects/fusion/), a server-side MCP server orchestration system, which won the Best Developer Tool Prize üèÜ at the Penn Generative AI Hackathon.

Aside, I led [TEDxPenn](https://www.tedx-penn.com/), the `TEDx` student club at UPenn and the largest student-ran TEDx organization in the world. Check out more about the [TEDxPenn 2025 Conference](https://www.tedx-penn.com/2024-conference) here!
