I am a junior student at the University of Pennsylvania completing my B.A. in `Computer Science` and `Computational Biology`, also pursuing my Accelerated MSE in `Robotics`.

As a Premed-turned CS student, technology and life science research are my greatest passions. Previously I served as an undergraduate researcher at the [Yang Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/yanglab/) `@Penn Cancer Biology`, where I studied the protein chaperone systems that protects against neurodegeneration.

Currently, I am a undergraduate researcher at the [Korb Lab](https://www.korblab.com/) `@Penn Epigenetics Institute`. I am also a Software Engineering Intern at [Grove AI](https://grovetrials.com/).

Many of my projects, such as [NeuraLIVE](https://github.com/stevensusas/NeuraLIVE) and [Vision4Science](https://github.com/stevensusas/Vision4Science-HackPrinceton), focus on using technology to better the life science workflow.

I am currently building [SciSketch](https://github.com/stevensusas/SciSketch-Summer), the world's first `AI-powered life science illustrator`.

Aside, I lead [TEDxPenn](https://www.tedx-penn.com/), the `TEDx` student club at UPenn and the largest student-ran TEDx organization in the world.
