I am a junior student at the University of Pennsylvania completing my B.A. in `Computer Science` and `Computational Biology`, also pursuing my Accelerated MSE in `Robotics`.

As a Premed-turned CS student, technology and life science research are my greatest passions. Previously I served as an undergraduate researcher at the [Yang Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/yanglab/) `@Penn Cancer Biology`, where I studied the protein chaperone systems that protects against neurodegeneration.

Currently, I am a undergraduate researcher at the [Korb Lab](https://www.korblab.com/) `@Penn Epigenetics Institute`. I am also a Software Engineering Intern at [Grove AI](https://grovetrials.com/).

Many of my projects, such as [NeuraLIVE](https://stevensusas.github.io/projects/3_project/) and [Vision4Science](https://stevensusas.github.io/projects/2_project/), focus on using technology to better the life science workflow.

Recently, I attended PennApps 2024 and built [Underflow](https://stevensusas.github.io/projects/5_project/), which won the **Best Use of Defang Challenge üèÜ**. I also attended Nucleate BioHacks NYC and built CompGrid, whic won the **Overall 2nd Place ü•à**.

I am currently building [SciSketch](https://stevensusas.github.io/projects/1_project/), the world's first `AI-powered life science illustrator`.

Aside, I lead [TEDxPenn](https://www.tedx-penn.com/), the `TEDx` student club at UPenn and the largest student-ran TEDx organization in the world.
