  abstract={When their linear amino acid sequence is translated and folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation, proteins
play crucial roles in various biological processes. However, proteins can undergo misfolding for various reasons, including
genetic mutations and translational errors. One prevalent consequence of misfolded proteins is insoluble aggregates. The
intracellular propagation of such aggregates underly pathogenesis in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.
To counteract the detrimental effects of protein misfolding, organisms across diverse kingdoms have evolved sophisticated
protein quality control systems that eliminate such aggregates. Recent studies have suggested that the tripartite motif
proteins (TRIM), may possess the ability to fulfill this function.

Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the aggregation of the polyglutamine-
expanded ATXN1 protein. In this study, we undertake a systematic analysis of virtually all known human TRIM proteins and

their potential to mitigate Atxn1 82Q aggregation in cultured HEK293T cells.

When co-transfected in HEK293T cells, TRIM10, 11, 55, 58 are potent disaggregases of GFP-Atxn1 82Q. Moreover, these
four TRIM proteins do not reduce Atxn1 82Q mRNA level and interact with GFP-Atxn1 82Q on a protein-protein level. These
results indicate these four TRIM proteins are potentially guardians against polyglutamine-expanded Atxn1 protein aggregation
and SCA1 pathogenesis.
