  title={Sedmentation Assay Screening of TRIM Proteins on Polyglutamated ATXN1},
  author={Hanqi (Steven) Su. Professor Xiaolu Yang},
  abstract={When their linear amino acid sequence is translated and folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation, proteins
play crucial roles in various biological processes. However, proteins can undergo misfolding for various reasons, including
genetic mutations and translational errors. One prevalent consequence of misfolded proteins is insoluble aggregates. The
intracellular propagation of such aggregates underly pathogenesis in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.
To counteract the detrimental effects of protein misfolding, organisms across diverse kingdoms have evolved sophisticated
protein quality control systems that eliminate such aggregates. Recent studies have suggested that the tripartite motif
proteins (TRIM), may possess the ability to fulfill this function.

Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the aggregation of the polyglutamine-
expanded ATXN1 protein. In this study, we undertake a systematic analysis of virtually all known human TRIM proteins and

their potential to mitigate Atxn1 82Q aggregation in cultured HEK293T cells.

When co-transfected in HEK293T cells, TRIM10, 11, 55, 58 are potent disaggregases of GFP-Atxn1 82Q. Moreover, these
four TRIM proteins do not reduce Atxn1 82Q mRNA level and interact with GFP-Atxn1 82Q on a protein-protein level. These
results indicate these four TRIM proteins are potentially guardians against polyglutamine-expanded Atxn1 protein aggregation
and SCA1 pathogenesis.

  title={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Interaction Between Sex and Epigenetic Factors on the Neuronal Transcriptome},
  author={Hanqi (Steven) Su. under supervision of Professor Erica Korb},
  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects millions worldwide, with males being more prone to diagnosis than females, at a ratio of 4.5:1. The cellular basis for this gender disparity remains unclear. Recent studies have identified several chromatin-modifying genes associated with ASD, which regulate gene expression by controlling genome accessibility. 
  This study investigates the interactions between these chromatin modifications and the sex-specific neuronal transcriptome. E16 cortical neurons were cultured and infected with lentiviral shRNA targeting chromatin-modifying genes, followed by RNA-seq analysis. Our findings reveal that Gpr153 is expressed 15% higher in male neurons and shows neuron-specific expression independent of hormonal differences. Additionally, the loss of Med13l and Chd8 results in a distinct, sex-specific neuronal transcriptomic response, impacting neurodevelopmental pathways. These results suggest that interactions between chromatin modifiers and the sex-specific transcriptome may contribute to the observed gender differences in ASD.},

  title={MEAnalysis: An R-package for Efficient Analysis & Visualization of Neuron Multi-Electrode Array Experiment Data},
  author={Hanqi (Steven) Su. under supervision of Professor Erica Korb},
  abstract={The MEAnalysis R package is an open-source tool designed for the efficient and automated analysis of neuron multielectrode array (MEA) experiment data, developed primarily for use at the Penn Epigenetics Institute. This package addresses the institute's need for a powerful and user-friendly tool to analyze and visualize data from their newly adopted MEA assays, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. The MEAnalysis package is built with object-oriented programming principles, emphasizing ease of use, scientific accuracy, scalability, and maintainability.
The package comprises three main classes: MEAnalysis, BatchMEAnalysis, and ElectrodeBursts. These classes provide comprehensive tools for single-file analysis, batch processing of multiple files, and visualization of electrode burst data, respectively. Users can generate detailed plots and significance tables, facilitating a deeper understanding of the experimental results.
The package supports both single and batch analyses, allowing researchers to streamline their workflows and focus on interpreting the results. It offers a flexible and scalable solution to meet the growing demands of high-throughput MEA experiments in neuroscience research.
